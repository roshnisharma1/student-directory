This text file contains information to create the student directory. A line with a four-digit integer (e.g. 1111) denotes a new student, with that integer representing the student's ID. Following the ID will be any classes the student is registered in. Each class will take up three lines, with the first line containing the course name (String), second line containing course number (integer), and third line containing course credit (integer). It is possible that a student could be in the directory but not be registered in any courses.
